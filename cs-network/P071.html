</center>
 <p align="left"><b>Objectives: </b>An introduction to mobile computing with a 
 strong emphasis on application development for the Android operating system. 
 Students will complete a major project with the goal of releasing an app on the 
 Android Market place. Topics will include the Android development environment, user 
 interfaces, activities, intents, content providers / content resolvers, 
 services, broadcast receivers, persistence, MBaaS, location, sensors, graphics, 
 and other Android features, tools, and capabilities.</p>

<p><b>Class Participation, iClicker</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Purchase an <b>iClicker</b> (a remote control device) from the Co-op 
  bookstore or the <a href="http://www.iclicker.com/purchase/">iClicker website</a>. <p>Beware: There may be several incompatible brands of remote control devices 
  on sale. Be sure you get the ``iClicker'' brand. For a picture of one, see the iClicker web site. We 
  are using the  iClicker+, not the iClicker 2, although the iClicker 2 or 
  original iClicker will work. <u><b>Note, the REEF POLLING tool is not an 
  option for my class</b></u>. The Co-op will buy back the iClicker for about 
  half the current price.<b> The serial number is important when you register 
  the iClicker (see the next step). If you need help determining your devices 
  serial number please see me before or after class or in lab hours.</b><br>
&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Register your iClicker at
  <a href="https://www1.iclicker.com/register-clicker/">
  https://www1.iclicker.com/register-clicker/</a>&nbsp; <b>
  <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">You must register at 
  the iClicker website for this course, not on Canvas. </span></b> <br>
  Register by providing:
  <ul>
    <li>your first name </li>
    <li>your last name </li>
    <li>your UT EID (which they call your &quot;student ID'&quot;) </li>
    <li>your clicker's ID (the serial number under the bar code on the back of 
    the device) </li>
  </ul>
  <p><b><span style="background-color: #FFFF00">Even if you already have a 
  iClicker and registered it in the past you must reregister for this semester. 
  After registering you DO NOT have to sign up for a particular class on the 
  iClicker website. </span></b><br>
&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Bring your clicker to every lecture. <u><b>Participation on  clicker 
  questions is graded. </b></u></li>
  <li><b>In order to get  credit for a given day you MUST:</b><ul>
  <li><b>have your functioning clicker with you <u>and</u></b></li>
  <li><b>answer one or more of the clicker questions during class <u>and</u></b></li>
  <li><b>register your iClicker at the iClicker website as described above by 
  the times monthly clicker grades are processed.</b></li>
</ul>
  </li>
  <li><b>If you do not meet these requirements you will not receive clicker credit 
  for that day.</b></li>
  <li><b>You can only receive credit by attending Mike's lectures.</b></li>

       Microlabs</a>. </b>PCs and Linux machines are available for assignments in the CS Department microcomputer lab 
       located&nbsp; on the 1st and 3rd floors of GDC, Dell Hall (north wing).&nbsp; You are 
	   <strong><span class="auto-style1">strongly encouraged </span></strong>to work on your own computer. </li>
     </ul>
     <p><b>Android Device:</b> You are NOT required to have an Android Device. 
     Development can be done on the Android Emulator. However there is no 
     substitute for testing on a real device. I have multiple Android dev phones 
     and tablets available for checkout during lab hours. </p>
     <p>If you do want to purchase an Android device past students have favored 
     Google Nexus tablets. Current version is the Nexus 9 tablet, but the older 
     Nexus 7's work as well. The only downside to tablets is they lack telephony 
     capability.</p>
     <p><b>Software: </b>Android development is done in Java. The 
     Microlab computers in GDC are set up to do Android programming. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You are <strong><span class="auto-style1">strongly encouraged </span>
</strong>to work on your own computer. The following software is required and 
freely available.</p>
<ul>
  <li>
  <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html">
  Java. I recommend version 8.</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html">Android SDK and

       The grading systems consists of 1000 points. The grade cutoffs are: &lt;600 = F, 600 -

<p><b><a name="Collaboration"></a>Academic Honesty: </b>Taken from the
<a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/undergraduate-program/code-conduct">CS 
     department Code of Conduct</a>. </p>
     <p>&quot;The University and the Department are committed to preserving the 
     reputation of your degree. It means a lot to you. In order to guarantee 
     that every degree means what it says it means, we must enforce a strict 
     policy that guarantees that the work that you turn in is your own and that 
     the grades you receive measure your personal achievements in your classes:</p>
     <p class="subhead">Every piece of work that you turn in with your name on 
     it must be yours and yours alone unless explicitly allowed by an instructor 
     in a particular class. Specifically, unless otherwise authorized by an 
     instructor:</p>
     <ul>
       <li>Students may not discuss their work with anyone except the instructor 
       and other members of the instructional staff (instructor, TA, lab 
       proctor or partner on a pair assignment).</li>
       <li>Students may not acquire from any source (e.g., another student or an 
       internet site) a partial or complete solution to a problem or project 
       that has been assigned.</li>
     </ul>
     <p class="subhead">You are responsible for complying with this policy in 
     two ways:</p>
     <ol>
       <li>You must not turn in work that is not yours, except as expressly 
       permitted by the instructor of each course.</li>
       <li>You must not enable someone else to turn in work that is not theirs. 
       Do not share your work with anyone else. Make sure that you adequately 
       protect all your files. Even after you have finished a class, do not 
       share your work or published answers with the students who come after 
       you. They need to do their work on their own.</li>
     </ol>
     <p><font color="red">The penalty for academic dishonesty will be a course 
     grade of <b>F</b> and a referral of the case to the <b>
     <a target="_blank" href="http://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/">Dean of 
     Students</a></b>. Further penalties, including suspension or expulsion from 
     the university may be imposed by that office.</font></p>
     <p>One final word: This policy is not intended to discourage students from 
     learning from each other, nor is it unmindful of the fact that most 
     significant work in computer science and in the computing industry is done 
     by teams of people working together. But, because of our need to assign 
     individual grades, we are forced to impose an otherwise artificial 
     requirement for individual work. In some classes, it is possible to allow 
     and even encourage collaboration in ways that do not interfere with the 
     instructor's ability to assign grades. In these cases, your instructor will 
     make clear to you exactly what kinds of collaboration are allowed for that 
     class.&quot;</p>
     <p><b>For CS371M I expect you to complete the tutorials on your using the 
     provided code when given. </b></p>


     <p><b>For your projects I expect you to do significant work on your own.
     </b></p>


     <p><b>You <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">can use class examples 
     and examples from the web</span>, but these must be documented. </b></p>


     <p><b>To be clear, a significant amount of work on your project must be 
     your own, but it is okay to incorporate code samples and 3rd party 
     libraries.</b></p>

<ul>
       <li>Tuesday, July 11 3: Last day of the official add/drop period fro 
	   second session classes; after

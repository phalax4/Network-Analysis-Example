<center class="header"><font size="5">Syllabus<b> - </b>Computer Sciences 312 
-Introduction to Programming<br>
The University of Texas at Austin � Fall 2017</font><hr>
</center>
 <p align="left"><b>Description: </b>Computer science encompasses a wide range 
 of topics and skills designing and building computer devices (e.g., your cell 
 phone, laptop, cleaning robots), designing and building programming 
     languages (e.g., Java, Python, C) and the supporting software that control 
     these devices (e.g., operating systems, compilers), and the actual 
     applications themselves (e.g., reading an x-ray, video animation, voice 
     mail). This course focuses on how to write computer programs that solve 
     problems on a general purpose computer. </p>
     <p>Programming is one of the key tools that computer scientists use to help themselves and others use  to solve 
     problems. This course  uses a particular programming language, Java, to 
     introduce you to how to use a computer to solve your problems. In this 
     course, most of your learning will take place when you are putting in to 
     practice the concepts from the book and lectures to solve more and more 
     complex problems using more and more sophisticated programming practices. 
     You will learn by doing. Performance on the programming assignments and 
     performance on exams correlate closely.<p>Programming is a skill learned by 
experience, not just listening to lecture. To gain that experience <b>I <u><i>
strongly</i></u> encourage you to do as many extra problems as time allows. </b>See 
the schedule for extra problems from the textbook and websites with practice 
problems.<p><b>Objectives: </b>This is a first course in computer programming. The 
     purposes of the course are to learn fundamental computer science concepts 
     including algorithm development, problem decomposition, data types, 
     variables, parameters, decision making, iteration, arrays, and 2D arrays. By the end of 
     the course students are expected to be able to implement programs 
     consisting of several programmer defined data types and several hundred 
     lines of code employing non trivial algorithms.<p>Estimates of the required effort to pass the class are:</p>
     <ul>
       <li>3-5 hours per week of studying</li>
       <li>2-10 hours per week of programming (less early in the course, more 
       later)</li>
     </ul>
     <p> <b>Prerequisites: </b>Credit with a grade of at least C- or 
     registration for Mathematics 408C, 408K, or 408N..<p><b>Discussion Sections</b><p>&nbsp;<table cellspacing="1" width="87%" class="auto-style1">

implore you to not use class time to e-mail, update your Facebook page, post to 
Instagram, etc. If you are addicted to the your smartphone, laptop, or tablet, 
consider this class your social media free zone. Further, I guarantee you that you will not 
do well in the course if you are simply looking up long enough to type out 
what�s on the projector screen before you return to see whether somebody �liked� 
your comment about the Cheerios you had for breakfast. In fact, the empirical 
research on this topic is clear: people are incapable of learning and retaining 
information when they are multi-tasking on their computers (and it�s a 
distraction to the people sitting around you that are trying to learn 
something). </font></p>
<p><b>Class Participation, iClicker</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Purchase an <b>iClicker</b> (a remote control device) from the Co-op 
  bookstore or the <a href="https://www.iclicker.com/pricing#remote-prices">iClicker website</a>. <p>Beware: There may be several incompatible brands of remote control devices 
  on sale. Be sure you get the ``iClicker'' brand. For a picture of one, see the iClicker web site. We 
  are using the  iClicker+, not the iClicker 2, although the iClicker 2 or 
  original iClicker will work. <u><b>Note, the REEF POLLING tool is not an 
  option for my class</b></u>. The Co-op will buy back the iClicker for about 
  half the current price.<b> The serial number is important when you register 
  the iClicker (see the next step). If you need help determining your devices 
  serial number please see me before or after class or in lab hours.</b><br>

       <li>Grades will be maintained on the
       <a href="https://utexas.instructure.com/">University Canvas site</a>. <br>
&nbsp;</li>
       <li>Programming assignments, iClicker participation, and quizzes can 
       count no more than 350 points towards your final average. Note, points 
       for the programming 
       assignments, iClicker participation, and quizzes add up to 375 points. 
	   There are 25 points of &quot;slack&quot; in these 
       non-exam components. This slack is&nbsp; to 
       account for any non academic issues that may occur during the semester that cause 
       you to miss one or more of these non-exam components. (Such as illness, family 
       emergencies, hardware problems, etc.) <br>
       <br>
       <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"><b><u>Quizzes, programming 
       assignments and iClicker participation cannot be made up for any reason</u>.
       </b> </span>For programming assignments 
       there is <b><i>some</i></b> leeway. See the explanation of slip days below.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
       <li>The final letter grades will be assigned based on your total points 
       out of 1000 points. The grade cutoffs are: &lt;600 = F, 600 - 
       699 = D, 700 - 799 = C, 800 - 899 = B, &gt;= 900 = A. Plusses and minuses (+ 
       and -) will be assigned to scores within 25 points of the cut offs. So 
       for example total points 875 to 899 earn a B+ and total points 900 to 924 
       earn an A-.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
       <li><strong><span class="auto-style3">Note, points are NOT added to your 
	   final total.</span></strong> The &quot;slack points&quot; are handled by basing 
	   your final average on 1000 points instead of 1025 points. There are 1025 points available in the course. Non-exam component 
       points are capped at a maximum of 350. In other words, earning more than 
	   350 points on the non-exam components will NOT result in points being 
       added to your exam point total. This means Canvas may overestimate your 
       grade in some cases.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
       <li>Depending on the results of an exam, exam scores may be adjusted. If so, 
     exam scores may stay the same or improve. Exam scores will never get worse 
     due to a adjustment. No other class components (programming assignments, clicker 
       participation, or quizzes) are curved.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
       <li>You have 6 slip days (max of 2 per assignment) to use through out the term on your assignments 
       if you are not able to turn an assignment in on time. See the assignments 
       page for details of the requirements for turning in assignments and how slip days work. <a href="assignments/index.htm">www.cs.utexas.edu/~scottm/cs312/Assignments/index.htm</a>. Slip days are 
       to account for life circumstances (My hard drive crashed!! I got a virus 
       downloading a BitTorrent file!!) and emergencies. 
       Do not use your slip days frivolously. If you use up your slip days and 
       late assignments will not be graded and be assigned a grade of 0.  <br>
&nbsp;</li>
       <li>The required format and procedures for turning in assignments are 
     available at <a href="assignments/index.htm">www.cs.utexas.edu/~scottm/cs312/Assignments/index.htm</a>.Assignments 
       that are not turned in to the correct directory in the correct format 
       will cause you to, lose points, and/or receive a 0 on the assignment.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
       <li>Quizzes are given at the beginning of most discussion sections. If 
       you are not present when the quiz is completed you receive a 0 for that 
       quiz. Quizzes cannot be made up under any circumstances. Quizzes are not 
       curved. Quiz grading will be: 10 for a perfect quiz, 7 - 9 for minor mistakes, 
       and 6 or less for little or no effort.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
       <li>If a student misses exam 1 or exam 2 with a verifiable excuse, then the 
     remaining exams will count for the missed exam.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
       <li>If you believe we have made an error in grading an 
       <b>assignment</b>, you must submit your complaint via email, along with 
       supporting evidence, to your grader  within <u><b><i>5 days</i></b></u> of the date the teaching staff first attempted to
return the assignment  to you. (This includes posting notices on Piazza.)<br>
&nbsp;</li>
       <li>Questions about your grade are to be sent to the TA assigned to 
       your section. See the table above for TAs and section unique ids.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
       <li>You may request a regrade of an <b>exam</b> if you feel the grading criteria 
       was not applied correctly. To ensure accuracy the entire exam will be 
       regraded and your score may go down. You must request the regrade during 
       the section or class you exam is returned to you. If you leave the class 
       or discussion section you cannot request a regrade. <b>I will not regrade 
       exams that have been in your unsupervised possession.</b><br>
&nbsp;</li>
       <li>The only opportunity for extra credit in this course is 5 points for 
       completing the end of term, Course Instructor Survey (CIS). These 5 
       points are added to your non exam point total.</li>
</ul>
<p>Of the roughly 1500 students who have taken CS312 with me:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>78% </b>of the students earned a <b>C- or higher:&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  36% A's,&nbsp; 28% B's,&nbsp; 14% C's</b></li>
  <li><b>11% </b>earned a <b>D or F.</b> </li>
  <li><b>11%</b> dropped or withdrew from the class,<b> </b>grade symbols<b> Q 
  or W.</b> </li>
</ul>
<p><b>Guiding Principle - No whining:</b> Feedback and concerns about the course are always welcome; 
legitimate grading errors that are identified in a timely fashion will certainly 
be corrected, but whining is counter-productive and will only irritate those who 
evaluate your work to determine grades. </p>
<hr>
<p><b>Important Dates for Changing Academic Status and Dropping the Course: </b>Refer to the
<a href="https://registrar.utexas.edu/calendars/17-18">Registrar's academic calendar</a> for the deadlines for changes in academic 
     status. Highlights are:</p>
<ul>
       <li>Tuesday, September 5: (4th class day) Last day of the official add/drop period; after 
       this date, changes in registration require the approval of the department 
       chair and usually the student�s dean.</li>
       <li>Friday, September 15: (12th class day) Last day to drop for a possible refund. Last 
       day to add a course.</li>
       <li>Tuesday, November 7: Last day an 
       undergraduate student may, with the dean�s approval, withdraw from the 
       University or drop a class (Q drop) except for urgent and substantiated, 
       nonacademic reasons. Last day a student may change registration in a 
       class to or from the pass/fail or credit/no credit basis. <b>UT no longer 
       requires instructor permission to drop a class. However, I am notified of 
       the request to drop and <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">if you 
       are involved in an ongoing academic dishonesty case the drop will not be 
       approved. </span></b></li>
       <li>After Tuesday, November 7, students must go to the academic advisors 
       in their college Dean's office if they wish to drop or withdraw from the 
       class.</li>
       <li>To be eligible for an <b>
       incomplete (UT uses the symbol X to indicate incompletes)</b> you must have a letter grade of
       <b>C-</b> or better and a 
       written, verifiable excuse for missing the last test. This is a <b>
       necessary</b> but <b>insufficient</b> condition for receiving an 
       incomplete. In general, I do <b><span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
       not</span></b> give incompletes (X's) so that you may make up large 
       portions of course work. </li>

<p><b><a name="Collaboration"></a>University Code of Conduct<br>
<br>
The core values of the University of Texas at Austin are learning, discovery, 
freedom, leadership, individual opportunity, and responsibility. Each member of 
the University is expected to uphold these values through integrity, honesty, 
trust, fairness, and respect toward peers and community.</b></p>
<p><b>Academic Honesty: </b>Taken from the
<a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/academics/conduct">CS 
     department Code of Conduct</a>. </p>
     <p>&quot;The University and the Department are committed to preserving the 
     reputation of your degree. It means a lot to you. In order to guarantee 
     that every degree means what it says it means, we must enforce a strict 
     policy that guarantees that the work that you turn in is your own and that 
     the grades you receive measure your personal achievements in your classes:</p>
     <p class="subhead"><b><span style="background-color: #FFFF00">Every piece of work that you turn in with your name on 
     it must be yours and yours alone unless explicitly allowed by an instructor 
     in a particular class. Specifically, unless otherwise authorized by an 
     instructor:</span></b></p>
     <ul>
       <li>Students may not discuss their work with anyone except the instructor 
       and other members of the instructional staff (instructor, TA, lab 
       proctor or partner on a pair assignment).</li>
       <li>Students may not acquire from any source (e.g., another student or an 
       internet site) a partial or complete solution to a problem or project 
       that has been assigned.</li>
     </ul>
     <p class="subhead">You are responsible for complying with this policy in 
     two ways:</p>
     <ol>
       <li>You must not turn in work that is not yours, except as expressly 
       permitted by the instructor of each course.<br></li>
       <li>You must not enable someone else to turn in work that is not theirs. 
       Do not share your work with anyone else. Make sure that you adequately 
       protect all your files. Even after you have finished a class, do not 
       share your work or published answers with the students who come after 
       you. They need to do their work on their own. This means do not post your 
       solution code to any public web site such as public repositories on 
       GitHub. Do not post 
       your work to the web even after you have completed CS312.</li>
     </ol>
     <p><font color="red"><b>The penalty for academic dishonesty will be a course 
     grade of F and a referral of the case to the
     <a href="http://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/" target="_blank">Dean of 
     Students</a>. Further penalties, including suspension or expulsion from 
     the university may be imposed by that office.</b></font></p>
     <p>One final word: This policy is not intended to discourage students from 
     learning from each other, nor is it unmindful of the fact that most 
     significant work in computer science and in the computing industry is done 
     by teams of people working together. But, because of our need to assign 
     individual grades, we are forced to impose an otherwise artificial 
     requirement for individual work. In some classes, it is possible to allow 
     and even encourage collaboration in ways that do not interfere with the 
     instructor's ability to assign grades. In these cases, your instructor will 
     make clear to you exactly what kinds of collaboration are allowed for that 
     class.&quot;</p>
     <p>For CS312 the policy on collaboration is modified as follows:  </p>
     <p><b>If you are repeating the course you may reuse code you completed on 
     your own. You may NOT use code from a program you worked on as part of pair 
     or code that was from a program involved in an academic dishonesty case. 
     You must start from scratch on any and all programs that:</b></p>
     <ul>
       <li><b>were part of an academic dishonesty case</b></li>
       <li><b>you worked with a partner during a pervious semester</b></li>
       <li><b>you are working with a partner this semester</b></li>
</ul>
     <p>You are encouraged to study for tests together, to <b><i>discuss</i></b> 
     methods for solving the assignments, to help each other in using the 
     software, and to discuss methods for debugging code. <b>Essentially
if you <i>talk</i> about an assignment with any one else you are okay, 
     <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">but the
moment you start <i>looking at someone else's source code</i> or <i>showing 
     someone else your source code </i>you have crossed the line into 
     cheating. </span> </b>You should not ask anyone to give you a 
     copy of their code or, conversely, give your code to another student who 
     asks you for it. Similarly, you should not discuss your algorithmic 
     strategies to such an extent that you and your collaborators end up turning 
     in exactly the same code. <u><b>Discuss</b></u> high level approaches together, but do 
     the coding on your own.<b> </b></p>
     <p><b>Examples of cheating </b>are many and include accessing another 
     student's account, looking at someone else's solution code, copying or 
     downloading someone else's solution code, referring to solutions from 
     previous semesters, having another student walk you through the solution 
     and how to code it, having another student perform significant debugging of 
     your code, having another student write your code for you and / or allowing others to copy of 
     access your solution code. <b><span style="background-color: #FFFF00">This means you
     </span></b> <u><b><span style="background-color: #FFFF00">shall not</span></b></u><b><span style="background-color: #FFFF00"> look on the 
     internet for code to solve your problems and you shall not post your 
	 solution code to a publicly accessible web site.</span></b></p>
     <p><b>Examples of allowable collaboration </b>include discussions and 
     debate of general concepts and solution strategies and help with syntax 
     errors. </p>
     <p><b> The code you can reuse in this course are:</b></p>
     <ol>
       <li><b>You may use any code you develop with the instructor, TAs, or 
       proctors.</b></li>
       <li><b>You may use code (with attribution) from the class slides and the class coding examples. </b></li>
       <li><b>You may share additional test cases and expected results of test 
       cases. You may not share solution code or experiment code.</b></li>
     </ol>
     <p><b>You shall not make use of code you find from other sources including 
     the world wide web. Materials from the web should only be used for 
     educational purposes. Thus, you can read about linked lists and look at 
     examples of linked list code, but you must not copy any code from the web 
     or be looking at any of this code from the web when writing anything you 
     turn in. </b></p>
     <p>You are also allowed to post short segments of code (2 lines or less) of code 
     that are giving you syntax errors to the class listserv in order to get 
     help on fixing the syntax error.</p>
     <p><b>If you have any doubts about what is allowed, ask the instructor.</b></p>
<p><b><span style="background-color: #FFFF00">Plagiarism detection software will be used on  assignments to find
students who have copied code from one another.&nbsp;</span></b><span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
